Car insurance pricing is almost flat. That's probably bad for you - if your car's at rest 6 days a week, and you're a super-safe driver, you shouldn't pay as much as that guy who's driving to work every day like some maniac. 
We offer a pay-as-you-go car insurance using a real-time risk analysis algorithm, combined with hardware that's plugged into your car's computer, to calculate your personalized premium for every ride.
